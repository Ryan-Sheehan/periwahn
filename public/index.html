      Bring a costume (or 2 or 3) and anything you need to sleep (another
      costume maybe, up to you). We will have over 100 acres to roam. There
      will be a big fire. Your friends will be there. If you do not have a
      car, you can take a bus to Dartmouth and someone will pick you up. If
      you need to coordinate a ride, reach out (: There will be a grill.
      Bring some of your own food and/or food to share. Others are welcome—
      just let me know."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
